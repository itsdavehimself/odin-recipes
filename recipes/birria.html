        <h2>What is Birria?</h2>
        <p>
            Birria is a popular Mexican dish that originated in the Jalisco state. 
            It is traditionally made with lamb meat, but it is common for people 
            to use beef today since it is more affordable and easier to find throughout 
            Mexico and the United States.
        </p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <h4>For the meat:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>1 Lb Bone-In Lamb Ribs</li>
            <li>1 Lb Beef shank</li>
            <li>1 Lb Beef loin</li>
            <li>1 1/2 Tbsp Salt</li>
            <li>1 Tbsp Pepper</li>
            <li>1 Tsp Ground Cumin</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>For the Sauce/Broth</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>4 Dried Ancho Chiles</li>
            <li>4 Dried Guajillo Chiles</li>
            <li>1 Chipotle Pepper</li>
            <li>8 Peppercorns</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Season the meat with salt, pepper, and cumin</li>
            <li>Cut open the dried chiles with scissors and remove the seeds</li>
            <li>Fry the dried chiles with a small amount of oil in a frying pan for 2-3 minutes, moving constantly so they don't burn. Set aside</li>
            <li>Add the chiles from the previous step to a small pot with boiling water for about 10 minutes, or until softened.</li>
            <li>In the same frying pan where you fried the chiles, add 1 tablespoon of oil and cook the onions and tomatoes until they are browned. Add the garlic, peppercorns, bay leaves, cinnamon stick, and all of the remaining spices except for the ground cumin and ginger. Continue cooking for about 5 minutes, moving it around often.</li>
            <li>Add the chiles (including the water), the ingredients from the previous step, and the ginger, cumin, apple cider vinegar and water to a blender and blend until smooth. It will still be pretty thick, but that is fine. Strain and set aside the resulting sauce for the next step.</li>
            <li>Pour the sauce over the meat in a large bowl and cover. If using the oven or stovetop methods, you will want to marinate for at least 2 hours or overnight. If using the electric pressure cooker option, you can marinate it, but it isn't necessary.</li>
        </ol>
