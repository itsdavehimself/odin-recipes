        <h2>What are Nalesniki?</h2>
        <p>
            Naleśniki are basically crepes! I know you probably associate crepes with France, 
            but they are really very popular in many European countries, including Poland. 
            This is not a new Polish dish, that is beginning to gain popularity in Poland, 
            like for example carrot cake or anything pumpkin. My grandma was making them since 
            I can remember. Polish crepes with cheese filling are called naleśniki z serem in Polish, 
            which means crepes with cheese. Naleśniki is plural, the singular is one naleśnik.

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup (125g) all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 1/4 cup (300g) milk</li>
            <li>3 large eggs</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons sugar</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract or vanilla sugar</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons melted butter or vegetable oil</li>
            <li>Pinch of salt</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Add all the ingredients for the crepes into a medium bowl (flour, eggs, milk, vanilla, melted butter, sugar, salt). Whisk until combined and smooth (although small lumps are ok), you can do that by hand, with a mixer, in a food processor or a blender. The batter will be thin.</li>
            <li>Cover the bowl with a kitchen cloth or plastic foil and set aside for 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Brush the pan with a small amount of butter (I’m only adding the butter before the first crepe). The pan should be well-heated, I’m cooking my crepes over high heat. Holding the pan in the air (it shouldn’t be on the burner), pour in the batter, tilting the pan simultaneously until the batter evenly coats the bottom of the pan. Place the pan on the burner and cook for about a minute.</li>
            <li>The crepe is ready to turn over when its edges look dry and lacy and its bottom is golden brown.</li>
            <li>Slide the spatula under the crepe (make sure it doesn’t stick to the pan) and flip it over.</li>
            <li>Cook on the other side just briefly, for about 10 seconds, until set. The crepe should be soft in the middle and a little crispy on the edges. Transfer on a plate.</li>
        </ol>
